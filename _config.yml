  Hi, I am Abdul Hannan, a Master's student at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. My research interests include **Fairness and Safety in Machine Learning Models and Reinforcement Learning Agents**. 

  I am working under Prof. Philip Thomas on a [library](https://seldonian-fairml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build safe models ([Github](https://github.com/hannanabdul55/seldonian-fairness)).

  I am also working on maintaing the [COVID-19 Forecast hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org) under Prof. Nicholas Reich.   

  When not in front of my laptop, I usually hike or go for a run. I also play the drums, mostly as a way to de-stress!

          This is a Python library that can be used by developers to train ML models, and RL Agents using the Seldonian Framework explained [in this paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/366/6468/999).
          You can use any of the existing optimization techniques in [scipy.optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) package or also use the [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) implementation in the library.

          Fairlearn is an Open Source python library started at Microsoft that can be used to train ML models under various constraints.
          I implemented the Equality of Opportunity constraint on Fairlearn and worked on experiments on scalability of trained models in Fairlearn.

        description: |
          Worked on the CMUSphinx library on porting it to mobile devices. This is a Java library that maps speech to a unique identifier. This can be used in a sbtract way to map these IDs to _specific_ actions/triggers.   

          This speech recognition library is language agnostic. As a part of the project, we also ported some modules of the Sphinx package to Android.
      - title:  Unified Heterogeneous Hybrid Cloud Management
        layout: left
        description: |
          This Project aims at creating a unified management interface for the vSphere and Openstack clouds which aids in easy interoperability between the two clouds and flexibility of choice to deploy applications in either one of the infrastructures.  

          In order to facilitate the above requirement, a plugin for VMware vSphere was developed which could seamlessly interact with the OpenStack Deployment and perform all the basic cloud functionalities like Instance deployment, suspension, etc. with a single Unified platform without gaining the extra knowledge of usage of the OpenStack interface. Additionally, a seamless private networking interface was also created between the VMs of a tenant which are distributed between the two clouds.

        description: |
          Hybrid clouds help in establishing a cost effective, reliable and scalable solution to limitations in traditional on-premise data-center. There is an increasing requirement for federated hybrid cloud solutions to allow private clouds to leverage different public cloud providers. Federated cloud solutions should accommodate infrastructure constraints, balance load between different clouds and keep the cost at a minimal for the client. The following paper proposes an architecture for hybrid clouds called Simple Cloud Federation (SCF). It differs from existing architectures in that it leverages the hierarchical organization features already found in existing cloud systems. It is thus general and easy to implement across a variety of cloud systems, including OpenStack and Amazon. The paper contains details of our OpenStack implementation.
